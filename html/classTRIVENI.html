<p>It has been developed for Reactor Physics Computer Code Development For Neutronic Design Fuel-Management, Reactor Operation and Safety Analysis of Indian PHWRs. It is used for core follow-up of Indian PHWRs. It has been developed by Theoretical Physics Division of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, India.To carry out the fuel management tasks of the reactors under operation a computer code package was developed in the sixties. It was based on DUMLAC code for lattice parameter calculations and TRIVENI/DIMENTRI codes for core and fuel management calculations. This code system was considered inadequate for design of second series of 235 MWe PHWRs and larger reactors of 500 MWe. Hence, a broad based reactor physics research and development programme was undertaken to develop new code packages and their validation. These codes have already been used for commissioning problems of 235 MWe PHWRs, design problems of 500 MWe units and day to day fuel management of operating units. The starting point in any reactor physics calculation is a well proven multigroup cross-section library. We have made use of 69-group WIMS cross-aection set derived from UK Nuclear Data Library. In this cross-section set, there are 14 fast groups, 13 resonance groups and 42 thermal groups. There are tables for few resonance materials such as U235 , U-233,Pu-239 which give resonance cross sections as a function of effective potential cross-aection and temperatures. Temperature dependent thermal scattering matrices for a variety of scattering laws are included in the library for the principal moderators which include hydrogen, deuterium, graphite, beryllium and oxygen. The resonances at 0.29 ev for Pu-239 and at 1.06 ev for Pu-240 are treated by fine energy-group structure in these energy ranges. Originally only infinite dilution cross-sections were available in the library obtained from U.K. for Th-233 and U . The resonance cross-sections for these elements were generated by usng a simplified procedure of integrating the slowing down equation by multigroup technique. The fine group cross-sections were prepared using the basic data from ENDF/B-IV </p><dl class="section user"><dt>Lattice Physics</dt><dd>Three computer codes MURLI, CLIMAX and CLUB have been developed for lattice calculations. Both these codes are multigroup transport theory codes. CLIMAX code treat^s the cluster by ring homogenization procedure. CLUB code considers the cluster geometry explicitly. Both these lattice codes have been extensively validated through the analysis of Canadian experimental data for different sized clusters and with different coolants. The computed eigen- values and the reaction rates agree well with the corres- ponding measured values. Analysis of the available burnup measurements in NPD reactor also yielded good results. The calculated void coefficient for RAPS by both the codes is very close to the Canadian results. Thus the codes can be used for the routine design problems in PHWRs. The computer code CLUB has further been improved to generate hyperfine pin power distribution as a function of burnup. The fuel rod can now be subdivided in a number of annular regions and burnup equations can separately be solved for each annular region. Thorium-chain has also been included for biirnup. Apart from burnup equations in fuel, the code has been modified to treat burnable poison in moderator. Calculations of kinetics parameters like effective delayed neutron fraction <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\beta_{eff}$" src="form_0.png"/> and life time l can now be handled by the code CLUB. It is proposed to use 37 rod clustersin 500 MKe PHWRs. For this type of cluster, very little experimental results are available in the open literature. Therefore, it would be useful to perform some additional lattice experiments with 37-rod fuel cluster in order to gain more confidence. There is also a paucity of experimental burnup data in the literature about the isotopic composition of irradiated fuel bundles. It is, therefore, necessary to experimentally determine the number densities of various heavy nuclides in a fuel bundle as a function of irradiation. This data can then be used to check the various lattice codes at high burnups. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>CORE SIMULATION STUDIES</dt><dd>The core simulations are done in two group diffusion theory. These require :<ol type="1">
<li>Homogenised normal fuel lattice parameters in two energy groups from transport theory lattice codes,</li>
<li>Simulating the effects of reactivity devices</li>
<li>Core calculational models.</li>
</ol>
</dd></dl>
<p>The first of these requirements is met by the muitigroup lattice transport theory codes CLUB or CLIMAX explained earlier. PHWRs contain reactivity devices (RDS) like control adjusters and zone control light water compartments as well as shut down devices. They enter in a perpendicular direction compared to fuel channels. Simulation of these devices thus becomes complicated. This is implemented in two possible models based on</p><ol type="1">
<li>Supercell methods, and</li>
<li>Direct (non-supercell) methods</li>
</ol>
<p>The final stage of core calculation is hence linked with the choice of the reactivity device modelling. </p><dl class="section user"><dt>Supercell Methods</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>A 3D parallel piped containing part of the fuel channel and the reactivity device surrounded by the moderator form the supercell. The dimensions of such a supercell should essentially be derived from the assumption that the fluxes recover on the opposite edge of the supercell - or a zero net current boundary condition is possible on the sides of the super cell. In the models described here a supercell of one pitch length along the x - axis, half a bundle length along the axial z - axis (both nearly 25 cm) and half a pitch along the direction of insertion of RD is considered. Due to strong heterogeneities of the fuel and the RDs one should either employ a direct 3D transport theory model or arrive at effective boundary conditions on the fuel and RD surfaces and employ diffusion theory approach. Both these models have been developed in addition to employing Monte Carlo scheme for validation purposes.</p>
